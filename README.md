<h1>Webserv</h1>
<p>This back-end project aims to build a simple web server that allows users to navigate their websites through a browser. The server handles all GET requests on the back-end, delivering accurate results. It supports GET, POST, and DELETE methods and includes a customizable configuration file, enabling users to fine-tune the server to their specific needs. The web server also supports virtual servers, each capable of managing multiple ports, making it easy to handle different websites simultaneously. Built on non-blocking I/O and CGI technologies, the server ensures that no client experiences delays, even while others are uploading files or browsing the site.</p>
